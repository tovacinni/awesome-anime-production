# Survey of Technology for Anime Production

Japanese-style animation (colloquially known as 'anime') is an art form that generally involves hand-drawn frames which are organized using timesheets, which are time-series pointer-tables for frames. The word 'anime' in English communities have been semantically broadened to mean 'an art style that is reminiscent of popular art styles in Japanese manga / animation', but in this article we will refer to 'anime' as specifically 'animations created in a Japanese-style production flow'. 

Japanese anime production workflows have evolved over the years to be wonderfully complex, but technology adoption has generally been sparse. This is due to a number of different reasons, but one of them is that technology that actually suits the Japanese production workflow has generally been sparse. 

This repository aims to curate papers, talks, and blog posts which seem promising to be used inside production workflows for anime production. Eventually the long-term goal is to create a comprehensive document / paper / course to highlight opportunities and challenges for technological development for anime production.

This is very much work in progress.
